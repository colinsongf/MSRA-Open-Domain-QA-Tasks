# MSRA-Open-Domain-QA-Tasks

We build two open domain quesiton answering (QA) tasks for Chinese language, one is knowledge-based QA (or KBQA) and the other is document-based QA (or DBQA).

These two open domain QA datasets are used in http://tcci.ccf.org.cn/conference/2016/pages/page05_CFPTasks.html, and are the largest QA datasets for Chinese language.

More details about the datasets can be found in the guideline PDF, and you can also send your questions to nanduan@microsoft.com.
